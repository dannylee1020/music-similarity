# Predicting Music Similarity

## Project Overview
Recommender System is one of the fields that Deep learning is most actively applied. Outstanding recommendeing algorithm creates positive cycle of more engagement and activity on the platform, resulting in more behavioral data to fuel the algorithm to improve its performance. Despite many proven ways to build a recommender system, this project focuses on using song lyrics to predict if two songs are similar or different.
